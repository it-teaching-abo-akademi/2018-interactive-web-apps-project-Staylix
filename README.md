###	GitHub source code (on the master branch):

###	GitHub page (from the gh-branch publishing branch):
The page is from my personal GitHub, because, I don’t know why, the page on the GitHub class imported from this one doesn’t work. I think it is because of some settings from the npm run deploy.

###	Comments

For this project, I have used some libraries:

-	Bootstrap CSS: 	Just for a small part of my tags, and for the grid system.
-	react-chartjs-2: 	To plot the chart.
-	Material icon:	For the icons in buttons.
-	Less: 		To manage my CSS. It is a long time that I would like to try this kind of framework to easily manage my CSS, I it was the great opportunity.
-	I have also use code from loading.io for the animated icon that appear when the data are loading.
-	I have also taken some inspiration on w3school for my modal and my parallax image.
